Host a static site on S3 (Console)

Prereq: Have index.html ready.

Bucket & website setup
•	 Go to S3 Console → Create bucket
•	 Bucket name: static-website-hosting-shree (use one name everywhere; if you prefer static_website_hosting, replace it consistently in policy & URL)
•	 AWS Region: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
•	 Object Ownership: keep default (Bucket owner enforced)
•	 Block Public Access: uncheck “Block all public access” → confirm the warning
•	 Click Create bucket

Enable website hosting
•	 Open the bucket → Properties → Static website hosting
•	 Click Edit → Enable
•	 Index document: index.html
•	 Save. Copy the Website endpoint (will look like
http://static-website-hosting-shree.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)
Upload content
•	 Go to Objects → Upload → add index.html → Upload

Public permission (Bucket policy)
•	 Go to Permissions → Bucket policy → Edit → paste this JSON → Save
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::static-website-hosting-shree/*"
    }
  ]
}

Test
•	 Open the Website endpoint in a new browser tab
http://static-website-hosting-shree.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

Quick fixes:
• 403 (AccessDenied): Check “Block public access” is disabled and bucket policy saved.
• 404 (Not Found): Confirm object key is exactly index.html.
• No Styles/Images: Ensure you uploaded them and policy covers /*.
